# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-PyTorch

This project showcases the implementation of handwritten digit recognition using PyTorch. The process involves the setup of the dataset, development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, optimization, and subsequent training. A custom neural network was developed from scratch using PyTorch. The model underwent training on a dataset comprising 60,000 images from the MNIST dataset. Impressively, the model demonstrated a remarkable accuracy of over 98.85% when put to the test on a separate set of 10,000 images.
